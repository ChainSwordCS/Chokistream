## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to make Chokistream better!

When contributing a change, be sure to test your changes before and afterward to make sure your changes work. We don't have any unit testing at the moment, so just ensure there are no regressions by manually checking the relevant functionality.

There's no formal requirements for pull requests otherwise, but be sure to make it clear what your changes are intended to do.
